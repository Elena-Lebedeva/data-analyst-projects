## Machine Learning project - Churn prediction model

### Objective: 
* I have analysed data on gyms clients (socio-demographics and visits, contracts, frequency, charges)  in order to predict churn for the next month

### This project includes:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Building a Churn Prediction Model using Machine Learning 
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
- Model evaluation and selection based on accuracy, precision and recall
- Cluster Analysis, dendrogram and feature distributions for clusters

### Libraries used:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
    - sklearn.model_selection
    - sklearn.linear_model
    - sklearn.ensemble
    - sklearn.cluster
    - scipy.cluster.hierarchy
    - sklearn.metrics
